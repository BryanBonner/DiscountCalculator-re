# CS411-DiscountCalculator
## By Bryan Bonner for CPSC 411

### This app demonstrates:
* swipe gestures
* segues
* views
* MVC pattern
* singleton data model

The user puts in an original price, dollars off, discount percent, other discount percent, and tax percent. 
It then will calculate the discount price after tax is entered. 
If the user swipes left they will see the results in a graph form displaying original price, saved amount, pay amount.
